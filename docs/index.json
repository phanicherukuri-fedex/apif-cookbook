	"description": "REST standards to follow while designing services",
	"content": " REST Standards Purpose This document defines URI standards, dos and don’ts for Unified API strategy. In FedEx RESTful APIs, the client specifies an action using an HTTP verb such as POST, GET, PUT, or DELETE. It specifies a resource by a globally-unique URI of the following template\nURI Standards  Use only Nouns (No Verbs) Use plurals for resources like shipments/pickups Http methods used for verb  GET: Retrieve resource POST: Create resource PUT: Update resource DELETE: Delete resource  All the URI parts are in lower case URI Hierarchy is important Hackable \u0026lsquo;up the tree\u0026rsquo;. The user should be able to remove the leaf path and get an expected page back. Predictable\u0026gt; Human-guessable. If your URLs are meaningful they may also be predictable. If your users understand them and predict what a URL for a given resource is then may be able to go \u0026lsquo;straight there\u0026rsquo; without having to find a hyperlink on a page. If your URIs are predictable, then your developers will argue less over what should be used for new resource types. Query parameters are used for filtering/pagination/sorting. Tied to a resource. Permanent. The URI will continue to work while the resource exists, and despite the resource potentially changing over the time. This basically represents versioning part of the resources which doesn\u0026rsquo;t impacts or changes the current URI because every URI will have consumers. Return a representation (e.g. XML or JSON) based on the request header, like Accept and Accept-Language rather than a change in the URI.  Things to Avoid  Do not use characters that require URL encoding in URIs (e.g. spaces) Do not use singular nouns for resources Do not use mixed or camel case in URIs Do not use verb in URI. Few bad examples  POST https://api.fedex.com/update/shipment/12345 PUT https://api.fedex.com/update-shipment/12345 GET https://api.fedex.com/shipmentServices?action=updateshipment\u0026amp;trackingNumber=12345   Examples\n https://api.fedex.com/ship/v1/shipments  GET: Retrieves list of shipments POST: Create a new shipment PUT: Not supported: Currently we are only support one shipment at a time. DELETE: Not supported: Group shipment delete is not supported  https://api.fedex.com/ship/v1/shipments/{trackingNumber}  GET: Retrieves shipment details POST: Not supported: Shipment is already created vhj PUT: Update shipment details DELETE: Delete shipment  https://api.fedex.com/country/v1/countries?type=sender  GET: Retrieves list of countries for the type sender POST: Not supported PUT: Not supported DELETE: Not supported  https://api.fedex.com/country/v1/countries/US  GET: Retrieves the country detail for US POST: Not supported PUT: Not supported DELETE: Not supported   Resource Naming Resource naming is most important concept when creating an understandable, easily leveraged Web service API. When resources are named well, an API is intuitive and easy to use. The constraint of uniform interface is partially addressed by the combination of URIs and HTTP verbs and using them in line with the standards and conventions.\nSome tips are:\n In deciding what resources are within your system, name them as nouns as opposed to verbs or actions. In other words, a RESTful URI should refer to a resource that is a thing instead of referring to an action. Resource in a service suite will have at least one URI that URIs should follow a predictable, hierarchical structure to enhance understandability and therefore usability. Predictable in the sense that they\u0026rsquo;re consistent, hierarchical in the sense that data has structure relationships. This is not a REST rule or constraint, but it enhances the API.  RESTful APIs are written for consumers. The name and structure of URIs should convey meaning to those consumers. Let\u0026rsquo;s say we\u0026rsquo;re describing an order system with customers, orders, line items, products, etc. Consider the URIs involved in describing the resources in this service suite.\nResource Naming Anti-Patterns It\u0026rsquo;s informative to see some anti-patterns so that we can make sure what not to do. Below are some examples of poor RESTful resource URIs.\n Services use a single URI to specify the service interface, using query-string parameters to specify the requested operation and/or HTTP verb. For example, To update customer with ID 12345, the request for a JSON body might be:  GET http://api.example.com/services?op=update_customer\u0026amp;id=12345\u0026amp;format=json Though the \u0026lsquo;services\u0026rsquo; URL node is a noun, this URL is not self- descriptive It uses GET as the HTTP verb even though we\u0026rsquo;re performing an update  Here\u0026rsquo;s another example following the same operation of updating a customer:  GET http://api.example.com/update_customer/12345 GET http://api.example.com/customers/12345/update   "

Each application has common config entries, level specific entries.\nNote: It is not recommended to have application dev yml file in Config Service as it intended only in dev mode and doesn’t need integration.\nFollowing steps explain how to setup Config Service in local and connect.\n Config Service Run the Config Service application ConfigServerApplication. By default config service spring boot app starts on the port 8888. Configurations for level specific can be fetched using http://localhost:8888/config/{cxs-application-name}/{profile} CXS connects to config server based on configuration defined in bootstrap-dev.yml. If fail fast is marked as false, CXS will ignore even if config server is not connecting. e.g.,   spring: cloud: config: fail-fast: false retry: initial-interval: 1000 max-interval: 2000 max-attempts: 100 uri: http://localhost:8888/config  Following is a snippet for availabilitycxs from config server in local.

CXS needs registry service if it has to use Discovery client for CFMS. In order to disable connecting to registry service, comment out the @EnableDiscoveryClient on the main application class.\nSteps to setup Eureka service in Local:\n Check out Registry CXS Build and run the application by running the main class - CxsregistryApplication. Verify application start up CXS connects to registry based on below configuration in dev yml files.  #application-dev.yml discovery: registry: user: admin password: admin eureka: client: serviceUrl: defaultZone: http://localhost:8761/regs/eureka/  CFMS CXS connects to CFMS to populate messages. CFMS can be invoked through over APIG or CXS directly. In CXS 3.5, CFMS is connected through Discovery Client capability of Spring Cloud. To configure the same, following entries need to be present in respective cxs yml files.\ncfms.v3.service.hostname: cfms cfms.v3.callThroughAPIG: false cfms.v3.service.uri: /customermessage/v1/messages/info cfms.v3.service.secured: false cfms.v3.service.media.types: application/json cfms.v3.service.response.version: apig-cxs-v3 cfms.v3.service.request.media.types: application/json  Hystrix Dashboard CXS connects to Hystrix(through registry service) and publishes its metrics. Follow below steps to setup HDBS in local view local CXS metrics.\n Check out HDBS Build and run the application at HystrixMonitorApplication. View the application at below URL\u0026rsquo;s:  http://localhost:7999/hdbs/hystrix.stream http://localhost:7999/hdbs/hystrix/monitor?stream=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A7999%2Fhdbs%2Fturbine.stream   DevFramework Devframework integration is needed to make a secure call to any secured backend system. We need to configure the following:\n Uncomment the devframework dependencies \u0026ldquo;css jar\u0026rdquo; pom entries in master pom xml present at the root of the respective project. Path to client.properties file with keystore file location and other info. Usually there are only 2 set of files, one for lower levels (client.test.properties) and another one for PROD (client.prod.properties). Copy these files over from existing 3.0 application server to build-distribution/appsec directory in 3.5 project. These files are copied over to appsec directory on server during staging process. The configuration is done in resources/config/application-.yml as shown below Keystore file (*.p12). Usually there are only 2 set of files, one for lower levels (APP*.test.p12) and another one for PROD (APP*.prod.p12). Copy latest files over from existing 3.0 application server to build-distribution/appsec directory in 3.5 project. These files are copied over to appsec directory on server during staging process. These files are referred to from client.properties file mentioned above Path to security.properties file. Usually there are one such file per level (security.L0.properties, security.L1.properties etc. Copy these files over from existing 3.0 project or application server to resources directory in 3.5 project. These files are packaged in the main jar file for the application. The configuration is done in resources/config/application-.yml. fp.properties file, copy this file from existing 3.0 application to resources directory in 3.5 project. This file is packaged in the main jar file for the application. CDS uri and default service AppId.
